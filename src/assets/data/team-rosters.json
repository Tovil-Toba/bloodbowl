      "description": "The Amazons of Lustria are an enigma and several contradictory stories of their origins exist. One tells that long ago, driven by a desire for adventure, a group of Norse Valkyries set sail for distant shores. After a journey worthy of a saga in its own right, they founded a colony deep within the basin of a great river that wound its way through a massive rainforest. Cut off from the outside world, a new warrior society sprung up, borrowing customs from the native Lizardmen. Another legend claims that the Amazons were created by ancient, god-like beings to serve as the handmaidens of the gods. Perhaps both legends contain something of the truth, but either way, Amazons are natural athletes, and many possess the combination of agility and violence that marks them out as potential legends of the sport.",

Many believe they draw their name from their dark green skin, although the title is more likely derived from their dour demeanour and bleak sense of humour! Grim and singularly focused on violence, it’s no wonder so many flock to the Blood Bowl pitch! Black Orcs treat other Greenskins as little more than frivolous amateurs, largely because lesser Orcs are likely to squabble amongst themselves and focus too much on beating up the opposition, instead of concentrating on the game. Consequently, many Black Orcs refuse to play alongside other Orcs, choosing instead to form their own teams. Yet Black Orcs aren’t stupid – they know the importance of speed and agility. As a result, Black Orc teams make great use of Goblins, many of whom they become quite fond of, treating them as favourite pets and training them to be tough with regular clumps about the noggin!",

Whatever the case, wherever you find a Blood Bowl stadium, you’re guaranteed to find at least one team made up of an assortment of thoroughly debased, dedicated followers of Chaos. Most of the teams’ players tend to be Beastmen, hideous mutants who have given up their forest lairs for the sporting life, but their numbers are bolstered by the presence of superhuman Chosen, and frenzied and blood-crazed Minotaurs, Ogres and Trolls. Such teams are hardly subtle, often forgetting about the ball entirely as they grind their opponents into the turf, all in veneration of the Ruinous Powers they worship.",

They eschewed nobility and grace for power and glory, believing their immortality marked them out as the most powerful of all the world’s races. Their thirst for conquest led to a bitter civil war that rocked the Elven kingdoms. Dark Elf teams exhibit similar strengths and weaknesses to their Elven cousins, but are distinctly more aggressive in their game. But sheer spite makes the Dark Elves enjoy the running game, particularly when a team includes a remarkable player like Jeremiah Kool. In fact, it is hard to believe that the Flashing Blade won’t be tempted out of retirement – if not by the Darkside Cowboys, then by some other team.",

There are so many Dwarf teams around that it is possible to find one to champion almost any style of play. It is, however, the Dwarfs’ reputation for flamboyant illegality that makes them such a big hit with the fans. Since it was a Dwarf, now immortalised by the name Roze-El, who first translated Nuffle’s sacred laws and brought the game into being, most Dwarf teams believe they have a lasting right to alter the laws as they choose.",

Outrage abounded among players and fans alike, and it was only a matter of time before something was done about it. When that something finally happened, the formation of the Elven Union came as a surprise to no one. A loose federation of Elven teams, made up primarily of High Elf players but including the odd Wood Elf and even Dark Elf, the Union seeks to repair the damaged reputation of Elven teams and show that they can take Blood Bowl seriously. What the teams lack in funding, they make up for with experience and stubborn determination.",

After all, if you can get half a dozen players in the opposing team’s End Zone and, by some miracle, manage to end up with the ball, then there is a small chance that one or two of them won’t be jelly by the time you throw the thing! Probably the only real point in the Halflings’ favour is their long-held alliance with the Treemen who guard the forests of their realm, and a team that can tempt one (or two!) of them along to a game suddenly doesn’t look so pathetic!",

They believed there was no more to Blood Bowl than two teams of uncivilised yobs pummelling each other senseless in a display of mindless violence. It didn’t take them long, however, to realise that there was far more to it than that. High Elf teams are renowned for their passing game. They have many advantages when it comes to winning (as opposed to slaughtering the opposition, which isn’t always the same thing…), and their fine players are the epitome of the more graceful side of the game. The only real problem with High Elf teams is that they can be very picky about who, when or where they play, so we must be thankful they deign to play lesser races at all!",

More importantly, they do not suffer the weaknesses commonly associated with any of these players. For example, where Dwarfs are tough, they are also slow, Humans by contrast are hardy and relatively quick, and whilst Skaven are very quick, they are not as brave as Humans. It is hardly surprising then that Humans account for over half of all Blood Bowl players – counting Skeletons, Ghouls and Vampires playing for Undead teams, and mutants playing for Chaos teams!",

On the field, Lizardmen epitomise teamwork, with up to four different species working together on the pitch at a time. Skinks are the most numerous players, highly agile and as quick as lightning. They are balanced out by Saurus, fewer in number and not as fast, but capable of dishing out some serious punishment.

Although most teams started as a conglomerate of followers of all of the Chaos gods, it didn’t take long for teams to be more selective in their choice of deity. On the field, Nurgle teams are a terrifying prospect to face. What they lack in agility and coordination, they more than make up for with brute strength, a natural resilience to harm and a whole playbook of stomach-churning tactics devised to bring the other team to its knees. Nurgle teams defy conventional definition, being made up of Rotters, players who have contracted one or more of Nurgle’s many blessings; Bloaters, players swollen with disease; Pestigors, Beastmen attracted to the smell; and Rotspawn, players so blessed by the Plague God that they have devolved into hideously mutated beasts.",

Many Dwarfs come to build the tall towers and maintain the high walls of these great cities, whilst Halflings come to cook, eat and steal any small items they happen upon. Indeed, in these more enlightened times when warfare is considered a thing of the past, ever more varied races flock to these urban centres, so that today even Ogres are an increasingly common sight. Old World Alliance teams, though relatively uncommon, tend to form in the largest of cities, where cosmopolitan players of various races are drawn together to enjoy Nuffle’s great game.",

Indeed, if any fault can be found with Orc teams, it is that if they aren’t fighting amongst themselves, they’re spending too much time beating up the other team! Orcs have always respected brawn over intelligence, so their line of scrimmage is often overloaded with Big Uns and Troll players, adding even more weight to the front line. The Orc race also has close ties with other Greenskin races such as Goblins, and it is common to find such players in Orc teams.",

Today, they are a popular sight on the pitch. Fans love to see the reanimated dead shambling about, oblivious to all but the most debilitating of injuries, even as they dish out punishment to the opposition! Be it dry as dust Skeletons, their marionette movements mocking the living, or fresh Zombies, their moans and groans echoing around the pitch, accompanied by the fans' laughter at their awkward and stilted movements. Or from enraged Mummies, their unearthly roars of anger setting pulses racing, to sinister Ghouls stalking the wide zones, eyeing the crowds hungrily, Undead teams are a feast of sensations for eager fans!",

A new clan has been formed to govern and control the game – Clan Rigens – which consists of over 20 teams. The most famous are the Skavenblight Scramblers, twice winners of the Blood Bowl trophy. Several other teams have achieved successes in other, lesser leagues and competitions too, and there are mixed teams with a large proportion of Skaven competing at various levels. Of course, their close association with warpstone and the resulting mutations have helped with this success, but even the basic Skaven player has a lot going for them. It’s only a matter of time before a Skaven team makes it to the top again!",
