      "description": "The Amazons of Lustria are an enigma and several contradictory stories of their origins exist. One tells that long ago, driven by a desire for adventure, a group of Norse Valkyries set sail for distant shores. After a journey worthy of a saga in its own right, they founded a colony deep within the basin of a great river that wound its way through a massive rainforest. Cut off from the outside world, a new warrior society sprung up, borrowing customs from the native Lizardmen. Another legend claims that the Amazons were created by ancient, god-like beings to serve as the handmaidens of the gods. Perhaps both legends contain something of the truth, but either way, Amazons are natural athletes, and many possess the combination of agility and violence that marks them out as potential legends of the sport.",

Many believe they draw their name from their dark green skin, although the title is more likely derived from their dour demeanour and bleak sense of humour! Grim and singularly focused on violence, it’s no wonder so many flock to the Blood Bowl pitch! Black Orcs treat other Greenskins as little more than frivolous amateurs, largely because lesser Orcs are likely to squabble amongst themselves and focus too much on beating up the opposition, instead of concentrating on the game. Consequently, many Black Orcs refuse to play alongside other Orcs, choosing instead to form their own teams. Yet Black Orcs aren’t stupid – they know the importance of speed and agility. As a result, Black Orc teams make great use of Goblins, many of whom they become quite fond of, treating them as favourite pets and training them to be tough with regular clumps about the noggin!",

Whatever the case, wherever you find a Blood Bowl stadium, you’re guaranteed to find at least one team made up of an assortment of thoroughly debased, dedicated followers of Chaos. Most of the teams’ players tend to be Beastmen, hideous mutants who have given up their forest lairs for the sporting life, but their numbers are bolstered by the presence of superhuman Chosen, and frenzied and blood-crazed Minotaurs, Ogres and Trolls. Such teams are hardly subtle, often forgetting about the ball entirely as they grind their opponents into the turf, all in veneration of the Ruinous Powers they worship.",

They eschewed nobility and grace for power and glory, believing their immortality marked them out as the most powerful of all the world’s races. Their thirst for conquest led to a bitter civil war that rocked the Elven kingdoms. Dark Elf teams exhibit similar strengths and weaknesses to their Elven cousins, but are distinctly more aggressive in their game. But sheer spite makes the Dark Elves enjoy the running game, particularly when a team includes a remarkable player like Jeremiah Kool. In fact, it is hard to believe that the Flashing Blade won’t be tempted out of retirement – if not by the Darkside Cowboys, then by some other team.",

Dwarfs tend to use a running game, grinding their opponents into the ground as they go and working on the principle of high casualty rates opening up the field. There are so many Dwarf teams around that it is possible to find one to champion almost any style of play. It is, however, the Dwarfs’ reputation for flamboyant illegality that makes them such a big hit with the fans. Since it was a Dwarf, now immortalised by the name Roze-El, who first translated Nuffle’s sacred laws and brought the game into being, most Dwarf teams believe they have a lasting right to alter the laws as they choose.",

Outrage abounded among players and fans alike, and it was only a matter of time before something was done about it. When that something finally happened, the formation of the Elven Union came as a surprise to no one. A loose federation of Elven teams, made up primarily of High Elf players but including the odd Wood Elf and even Dark Elf, the Union seeks to repair the damaged reputation of Elven teams and show that they can take Blood Bowl seriously. What the teams lack in funding, they make up for with experience and stubborn determination.",

Their play style revolves around a seemingly endless arsenal of ‘secret’ weapons which the Gobbos sneak onto the pitch at every opportunity, and the assistance of lumbering Trolls who alternate between flinging their smaller team-mates up the pitch and absent-mindedly chewing on them instead!",

Most Halfling coaches, aware of the material that they have to work with, make up for quality with quantity. After all, if you can get half a dozen players in the opposing team’s End Zone and, by some miracle, manage to end up with the ball, then there is a small chance that one or two of them won’t be jelly by the time you throw the thing! Probably the only real point in the Halflings’ favour is their long-held alliance with the Treemen who guard the forests of their realm, and a team that can tempt one (or two!) of them along to a game suddenly doesn’t look so pathetic!",

They believed there was no more to Blood Bowl than two teams of uncivilised yobs pummelling each other senseless in a display of mindless violence. It didn’t take them long, however, to realise that there was far more to it than that. High Elf teams are renowned for their passing game. They have many advantages when it comes to winning (as opposed to slaughtering the opposition, which isn’t always the same thing…), and their fine players are the epitome of the more graceful side of the game. The only real problem with High Elf teams is that they can be very picky about who, when or where they play, so we must be thankful they deign to play lesser races at all!",

      "description": "Professional Human players are widely considered to be the best all-round Blood Bowl players in the Old World. What they may lack in the sheer strength of the Orcs, the agility of the High Elves, the toughness of the Dwarfs, the frenzy of the Dark Elves, or the speed of the Skaven, they make up for in sheer grit and determination! More importantly, they do not suffer the weaknesses commonly associated with any of these players. For example, where Dwarfs are tough, they are also slow, Humans by contrast are hardy and relatively quick, and whilst Skaven are very quick, they are not as brave as Humans. It is hardly surprising then that Humans account for over half of all Blood Bowl players – counting Skeletons, Ghouls and Vampires playing for Undead teams, and mutants playing for Chaos teams!",
